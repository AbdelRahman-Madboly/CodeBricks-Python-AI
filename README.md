# CodeBricks · Python → AI/ML

A structured, self-documented learning repository for going from Python fundamentals
to production-ready AI/ML engineering. Built around the principle that understanding
*why* code works matters more than memorizing *how* to write it.

## Phase 2 — Object-Oriented Programming `🔲 Not started`

> Learn to model real systems, not just write classes for the sake of it.

- Class internals: name mangling, `@property`, static vs class methods
- Namespaces and the MRO (Method Resolution Order)
- Inheritance: single, multilevel, multiple, `super()`
- Polymorphism: duck typing, operator overloading, abstract base classes
- OOP design: SOLID principles, composition vs inheritance
- UML: reading and sketching class diagrams

---

## Phase 3 — Pythonic Patterns `🔲 Not started`

> Write code that experienced Python engineers actually respect.

- Comprehensions: list, dict, set, generator expressions
- Generators and `yield`: lazy evaluation, memory efficiency
- Decorators: function wrappers, `functools`, parameterized decorators
- Context managers: `with` statement, `__enter__/__exit__`, `contextlib`

---

## Phase 4 — Standard Library `🔲 Not started`

> Stop reinventing what Python already ships with.

- `datetime` and `time`: parsing, formatting, timezones
- `os` and `pathlib`: filesystem operations
- `re`: regular expressions for real-world text processing
- `json` and `csv`: data serialization and parsing
- `threading` and `concurrent.futures`: parallelism basics

---

## Phase 5 — Code Quality `🔲 Not started`

> Write code you can maintain six months from now.

- Type hints and `mypy`: annotating functions and data structures
- `pydantic`: runtime validation and settings management
- `pytest`: unit tests, fixtures, parametrize, mocking
- `ruff`: linting and formatting at scale

---

## Phase 6 — Data Science Foundation `🔲 Not started`

> The bridge between Python engineering and AI/ML work.

- `numpy`: vectorized operations, broadcasting, linear algebra
- `pandas`: DataFrames, groupby, merging, time series
- `matplotlib` / `seaborn`: visualization for exploration and reporting

---

## Phase 7 — AI/ML Engineering `🔲 Not started`

> Go from toy examples to understanding what production ML actually looks like.

- ML concepts: bias/variance, overfitting, cross-validation, metrics
- `scikit-learn`: pipelines, preprocessing, model selection
- Deep learning: neural network fundamentals, backpropagation
- `PyTorch`: tensors, autograd, building and training networks
- Transformers and `HuggingFace`: fine-tuning, inference, embeddings
- Computer vision: image processing, CNNs, feature extraction, deepfake detection

---

## Phase 8 — Projects `🔲 Not started`

> Ship things. Broken code in production teaches more than perfect code in a notebook.

- CLI data pipeline with type-safe configuration
- REST API with FastAPI and Pydantic models
- ML classification project with full training and evaluation loop
- Transformer fine-tuning for a domain-specific NLP task
- Computer vision project (deepfake detection pipeline)

## Philosophy

**Think like an engineer, not a syntax memorizer.**

- Understand the *why* before the *how* — a concept understood at design level
  transfers to any language or framework
- Every example is grounded in AI/ML work — no abstract "calculate the area of a circle"
- Code review your own work as if you're the person who inherits it in six months
- Connect every pattern to a real problem — if you can't describe the use case,
  you don't fully understand the tool
- Difficult exercises are features, not obstacles — resistance is where learning happens
- Shipping imperfect code and fixing it beats studying perfect code and shipping nothing

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdelRahman-Madboly/CodeBricks-Python-AI.git
cd CodeBricks-Python-AI
```

Python 3.11+ recommended. No external dependencies for Phases 1–5.
